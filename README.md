Hi!

Name's Storm. I don't really care how do u call me tho.

I talk on both Russian and English. I can sometimes mess up some stuff on accident, sorry for any misunderstandings.

Most of my fandoms are written in my Tumblr. (don't mind me not posting for a long time, I'm lazy.) I like Ultrakill, plspls Ultrakill fans int, same for MD and AvM

This account is for my ponytown acc. Most of my ponies are roblox games cosplays, except for MD, AvM and Ultrakill

I mostly sit in the trees, at the lake in MD area and a little bit at AvM area near library. I like c+h a lot bro, same with touching and kissing random people who's cos I like. Same with interacting, I like interacting a lot (unless it's stated otherwise.) I'm mostly sitting in one area, so, uh, I've kinda seen some ppl around there.

(some ppl followed me, woah..)
